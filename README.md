This is a description of myself. Hello everyone, I'm Chris and I will be one of your ZeeMee influencers. I’m a sophomore majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Game Design and Programming. I enjoy hanging out with friends, sports like soccer, basketball, and playing drums. I’m also an international student from the Dominican Republic and a happy member of the international community at Marist.
